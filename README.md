# SRSLM

**Switch and Reweight with Shared Trace for Lifelong Partially Observable
Multi-Agent Pathfinding.**

SRSLM combines AORePlan and ARPE with a learned Switcher. When AORePlan
returns wait, ARPE is used directly; otherwise, the Switcher selects a branch.

## Install

Linux, Python 3.10 or 3.11, and a C++ compiler:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CQSWU/SRSLM.git
cd SRSLM
uv sync
```

## Run

```bash
uv run python evaluate.py --algorithms AORePlan
```

Download the [model weights](https://github.com/CQSWU/SRSLM/releases/tag/weights-v1)
and extract them into `weights/`. ARPE needs `EPOM-L` and `ARPE-Final-1B`;
SRSLM also needs `SRSLM-Switcher-Final-1B`. Experiment data is not included.

```bash
uv run python evaluate.py --algorithms SRSLM
```

## Train

```bash
uv run python train_arpe.py --config_path configs/train_arpe.yaml
uv run python train_switcher.py --config_path configs/train_switcher.yaml
```

ARPE trains with 200 agents. Switcher alternates between 50, 100 and 200 agents,
resuming the same model and optimizer between stages. Settings are in the YAML files.
Training and test maps are in `maps/train.yaml` and `maps/test.yaml`.
